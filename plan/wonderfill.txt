world resides inside a human's figurative heart

Chaos over the world from broken heart. Rift in center spilling chaos

Player fights creatures who come from the rift

Step based combat. Creatures select an attack square every turn that defeats the player the next turn
- need lots of save points through the map
- defeated player respawn at previous save point
- base combat happens by player moving into creatures
- strategic combat with planning
- different creatures have different attack and shapes
- player obtains hats that can modify combat or movement

west heart and east heart separated by rift, grown distaste for each other
- blame each other for the rift

player accompanies some scientist person who wishes to kill the host human to stop the rift
 scientist doesn't realize that this would end all  life on the heart as well
- scientist slowly goes crazy
- obsessed with his plan
- player is ultimately given a choice to either follow through or to oppose

player helps scientist collect parts needed to construct vessel
- this involves a journey the player and scientist take across the two halves of the heart
- journey encompasses a majority of the gameplay: fighting creatures, talking to people, doing minigames, exploring the world

gameplay:
- combat: step based strategic fighting with creatures from the rift. hats can modify player combat abilities
- exploration: explore large world with people to talk with and secrets to find. collect new hats, play minigames, find parts for the vessel
- puzzles:  interesting puzzles to find secrets or unlock special hats. lots of optional content to explore
- story: make decisions that guide the course of the story. multiple endings I guess
- detective: investigate secrets of this world and find your way to the true ending? :O

vessel, the ship to slay the host
- player collects parts like that Kirby game, but to construct instead of repair it
- need to travel to different villages to find different materials
- mast, engine, frame, aeronautics, flight computer
- not realistic because this is a figuratice world
- locations of parts are scattered across the world
? don't know exactly where but the scientist knows the name of the towns where they all are
- player can locate map if they need but it should be navigable without map

world:
-
