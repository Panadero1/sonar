# Plan for game

Name: sonar?

## Plot

### Goal

Get to the temple of silence and break the curse upon the land
You have a note with you that explains it

### Meta

Getting constantly chased by a creature who travels at night

Plot is not explained to the user - you have to explore the world to understand it

### Creature(s)

Only come out at night

{ Tangent: Quantity
	Perhaps there are many monsters?
	[MAYBE: Perhaps these creatures (except BBEG) are friendly during the day]
}

When exposed to enough light it is forced to sleep
The player has a 'flash' that can be used to scare it away
The flash only has a certain number of charges before it starts wearing down

## Gameplay

Open-world RPG-style game. Collect items to use & help you.
Limited actions per 24h cycle
Seasons change
Distance from summer and proximity to winter increases the time spend in night time
At the winter solstice there will be full darkness
At the summer solstice [TODO: MAYBE: something to inhibit player]
A day is like [TEMP: 6] actions long, so they go by fast

{ Tangent: Vitality
	Eat food to gain higher vitality (basically packing HP, food, energy, etc into one stat)
	Higher vitality helps with performing tasks
	Getting hit, performing labor-intensive things, etc reduces vitality
	
	{ Tangent: What happens when Vitality == 0?
		Vitality == 0 -> BBEG monster can see you and track you. It chases you down. Darkness eternal until you can eat again
		Vitality == 0 -> dead (GAME_OVER) & restart
	}
}

### Storms

Only in more adavnced areas
[TODO: Cause]
Large clouds bring disaster and ruin as pure energy pours from the sky
The BBEG monster does not come into here

### Combat

So far...
Plans are to have combat be simple & turn-based
No magic, per-se, but attacks are based around their spacio-auditory components

### Travel

How to get around?
Forced to travel light

## Art

Minimal, black & white
Changes balance as the night turns to darkness: white -> black & vice versa

### UI

Very little, if not none
