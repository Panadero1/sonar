## Now
* Change some tiles to entity (button, OneWay, SmileyMan)

## Eventually
* Line drawing algorithm
* More color palettes 

## Game
* Tutorial/start area
* Design enemy behavior (tethering, movement, attacks)
* Design friend behavior
* Time pressure for combat (makes you move randomly after timer)
* Bee area
* Add music

## Engine
* Make entities
* Draw trait
* When minigame over, return PostOperation
* Fix options page 
* Hats
* Comment your code lol 
* Make options work + config file + add to build script 
* Color config file (^^probably put in options config)
* Make custom serialize for World struct

## Maybe
* Consolidate drawing requirements into one struct
* Save compression
* Dynamic color palette (would need to write my own shader)

## Before release

* Remove editor controls

## Done
