## Now
* Entity creating in editor
* Change some tiles to entity (button, OneWay, SmileyMan)

## Eventually
* Line drawing algorithm
* More color palettes 

## Game
* Tutorial/start area
* Time pressure for combat (spawns time-based enemy?)
* Bee area
* Add music

## Engine

* When minigame over, return PostOperation
* Fix options page 
* Hats
* Comment your code lol 
* Make options work + config file + add to build script

* Make custom serialize for World struct

## Maybe
* Consolidate drawing requirements into one struct
* Save compression
* Dynamic color palette (would need to write my own shader)

## Before release
